# Re-Patreonize-Me

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) used to restore the Patreon Supporter badge back into Resonite. Contains settings to customize which Patreon logo to use and to set a custom color.

Note: The order of where the Patreon logo will vary due to the loading process of the new supporter badge being async. I may fix this in a future update, or wait until Resonite provides a fix.
