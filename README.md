# Re-Patreonize Me

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) used to restore or replace the Supporter badge into Resonite. Choose from a selection of supporter badges, or set a custom image as your supporter badge! You can also set a custom tint color to recolor any custom badges. Respawn for changes to take effect.

If a custom image is used, I recommend using an image with a resolution of 128x128 to match all other badges. The Custom Image field supports resdb, http, or https Uri's.

<3 Enjoy!

Note: Other users will need to allow custom name plates in order to see your custom supporter badge.
Issues: The order of where the Patreon logo will appear in you badges will vary due to the loading process of the new supporter badge being async. I may patch this in a future update, or wait until Resonite provides a fix.
